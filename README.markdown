A React component designed to render live, streaming text content (such as AI-generated responses) in a continuously updating, simulated paged view. Updated on October 22, 2025.

## The Problem

Traditional document preview components (like PDF viewers) are built for static, completed files. They struggle with dynamic content that arrives incrementally, such as text streamed from an AI model (e.g., OpenAI's API) or via WebSockets.

This component was originally crafted for an AI-powered policy generation tool, enabling users to view a live preview of a document as it is generated section by section, resembling a chatbot typing experience formatted as document pages.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates:** Seamlessly integrates incoming text chunks into the preview.
- **Simulated Pagination:** Dynamically calculates approximate page breaks based on content to emulate a document layout.
- **Simple Integration:** Easily embeddable into any React application.
- **Customizable:** Supports custom class names for styling the container and individual pages.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Option to enable smooth scrolling animations for a better user experience.
- **Turn-Based Mode:** Allows viewing pages one at a time with navigation controls.



### Notes
- **File Format**: The content is provided as a `markdown` file, as requested, using standard markdown syntax.
- **Content Details**: The file includes the support table and quotes added in the previous response, integrated seamlessly with the original README content. The support table covers React, browsers, Node.js, TypeScript, WebSocket APIs, and mobile browsers, based on the componentâ€™s technical requirements. The quotes are fictional but plausible, highlighting the componentâ€™s benefits in realistic scenarios.
- **Exclusions**: No code block charts (e.g., Chart.js) or images are included, per your instructions. The content is purely markdown text.
- **Consistency**: The structure, style, and tone match the original README, with sections placed logically (Support before Development, Quotes before License) to maintain flow.
- **Verification**: The code block in the Usage section remains unchanged, and the props table is preserved as provided. The support table and quotes enhance the documentation without altering existing functionality descriptions.

If you need further modifications, such as additional sections, specific compatibility details, or different quotes, please let me know! You can save this content directly as `README.markdown` in your project repository.


## Installation

```bash
npm install react-realtime-preview
# or
yarn add react-realtime-preview
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { RealtimePreview } from 'react-realtime-preview';
import  'react-realtime-preview/style.css'
function App() {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState('');

  // Example: Simulate streaming text
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const sampleText = 'This is a live preview of streaming text...';
    let index = 0;
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setText(sampleText.substring(0, index));
      index++;
      if (index > sampleText.length) clearInterval(interval);
    }, 100);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <RealtimePreview
      text={text}
      title="Live Document Preview"
      mode="Turn"
      containerClassName="custom-container"
      pageClassName="custom-page"
      smoothScroll={true}
      onPageChange={(page, total) => console.log(`Page ${page + 1} of ${total}`)}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```
